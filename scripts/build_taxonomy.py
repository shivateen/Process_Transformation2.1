"""
build_taxonomy.py — Generates src/data/taxonomy.json: the generic, function-agnostic
navigation spine for the Process Transformation Accelerator.

The accelerator is agnostic to function/process. A business SME drives:

    Function -> Process -> Role -> Objective -> Patterns (+ DAGs) -> Action Blocks

This generator builds that tree. AR Collections (Order-to-Cash) is fully populated
against the real 31-pattern library (patterns.json); four other functions ship as
"sample" entries with self-contained stub patterns so the framework is provably
agnostic and demoable end-to-end.

Pattern resolution at runtime: each objective carries patternIds. The Studio resolves
an id against the real library (window.PIQ.patterns) first, then falls back to
taxonomy.stubPatterns. Stub patterns share the exact shape of real ones so every
downstream stage (fitment, runtime) renders them identically.
